  Global Self Positioning System. A location tag system.
Unlike GPS, there is no need satellite, network, even smart phone.
Just need everyone and every government join us!

Definition:
 Every building, place in the world need a self-description(longitude, latitude..) tag.
 Human or device can read location from a tag.
 Everyone can publish a location tag.
 It should be useful if a power failure occurs, event after nuclear war!

If people tag their house, the system will work.
It can be a paper, a RFID tag, a andvanced device(for car, aircraft, ship..).
Don't worry about missile or bad guys, they know it! :-)

Applications:

Read the tag or scan it use your phone, then you can know where you are.

*Automatic navigation:
 Read nearby tags, car, aircraft, ship can locate itself.
