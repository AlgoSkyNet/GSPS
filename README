  Global Self Positioning System. A high precision, fast, low power cost, robust location tag system.
Unlike GPS, there is no need satellite, network, smart phone, even power.
Just need everyone and every government join us!

Definition:
 Every building, place in the world need a self-description(longitude, latitude..) tag.
 Human or device can read location from a tag.
 Everyone can publish a location tag, and it's free.
 It should be useful if a power failure occurs, event after nuclear war!

If people tag their house, the system will work.
Write longitude and latitude of the building on the paper, paste it on the wall. Done!
Don't worry about missile or bad guys, they know it! :-)
A tag can be a paper, a RFID tag, a andvanced device(location radio station..).

Applications:
*Map:
 If you lost in the world(city, forest, desert, sea), find a location tag.
Read the tag or scan it use your phone, then you can know where you are.

*Automatic navigation:
 Read nearby tags, car, aircraft, ship can locate itself.
 If there is no satellites, no network, no terrain-matching system, just read nearby tags!
 A RFID tag, a radio device, event a painting on the roof/ground can be used.

*SOS
 If you have a phone with NFC, scan a location tag, send location!
 If you haven't a NFC device, Use your eyes. :-p
